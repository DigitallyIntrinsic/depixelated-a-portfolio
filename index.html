      alt="Image of a male with glasses in a sweater and beanie, looking beyond the camera with a cityscape out of focus behind him." />
    <p>Born in 1989 in Florida.
      I am a student finding inspiration in my studies as I develop the tools and skills necessary to create and
      explore the next iteration of web development and applications.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Growing up in the age of ubiquitous internet,
      I was inspired by the infinite capabilities introduced to the world at large. Driven with a mission to present
      the possibilities of web design, I am pursuing new expressions through experiments and depixelated thoughts.
